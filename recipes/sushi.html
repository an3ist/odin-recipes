        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups Japanese sushi rice</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>6 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons wasabi paste</li>
            <li>8 ounces smoked salmon, cut into long strips</li>

            <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water.<br>
                Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.
            </li>
            <li>Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread rice on a plate<br>
                until completely cool.
            </li>
            <li>Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool rice on<br>
                seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed<br>
                uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange<br>
                smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on rice about 1 inch away from the<br>
                bottom edge of seaweed.
            </li>
            <li>Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to the top<br>
                edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and<br>
                serve. Repeat for other rolls.
            </li>
        </ol>
